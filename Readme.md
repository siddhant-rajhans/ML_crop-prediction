**1. Import Libraries:**

Python

```
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier  # Consider classification model
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
```



content_copy

- `import pandas as pd`: This line imports the pandas library, a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis in Python. We use it to read the data from a CSV file (`cpdata.csv`).
- `from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split`: This line imports the `train_test_split` function from the scikit-learn library (`sklearn`). This function is used to split the data into two sets: a training set used to train the model and a testing set used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
- `from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler`: This line imports the `StandardScaler` class from scikit-learn. This class is used to scale the features (columns) in your data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Scaling features can improve the performance of many machine learning models.
- `from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier`: This line imports the `DecisionTreeClassifier` class from scikit-learn. This class is used to create a decision tree model for classification tasks. (Note: You can experiment with other classification models from scikit-learn depending on your data and problem.)
- `from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score`: This line imports the `accuracy_score` function from scikit-learn. This function is used to calculate the accuracy of a classification model.

**2. Define Crop Labels:**

Python

```
crops = ['wheat', 'mungbean', 'Tea', 'millet', 'maize', 'lentil', 'jute', 'cofee',
        'cotton', 'ground nut', 'peas', 'rubber', 'sugarcane', 'tobacco',
        'kidney beans', 'moth beans', 'coconut', 'blackgram', 'adzuki beans',
        'pigeon peas', 'chick peas', 'banana', 'grapes', 'apple', 'mango',
        'muskmelon', 'orange', 'papaya', 'watermelon', 'pomegranate']
```



content_copy

This line defines a list named `crops` containing the different crop categories you want your model to predict. Make sure these labels match the labels present in your data (`cpdata.csv`).

**3. Load and Prepare Data:**

Python

```
# Load and prepare data (assuming 'cpdata.csv' has your data)
data = pd.read_csv('cpdata.csv')
```



content_copy

- `data = pd.read_csv('cpdata.csv')`: This line uses pandas to read the data from a CSV file named `cpdata.csv`. The data is stored in a pandas DataFrame object named `data`. A DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure similar to a spreadsheet.

**4. Handle Categorical Labels (Optional):**

Python

```
# Handle categorical labels (modify if your labels are text-based)
if not pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype(data['label']):
    data = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['label'], drop_first=True)  # One-hot encoding
```


content_copy

- This block checks if the `label` column in your data contains text labels for the crops.
- `if not pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype(data['label'])`: This line checks if the data type of the `label` column is not numeric. If it's not numeric, it means the labels are likely text-based.
- `data = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['label'], drop_first=True)`: If the labels are text-based, this line uses the `get_dummies` function from pandas to convert them into numerical features using one-hot encoding. One-hot encoding creates a new column for each unique label, with a 1 indicating the presence of that label and a 0 indicating its absence. The `drop_first=True` argument removes one of the created columns to avoid introducing redundancy.

**5. Separate Features and Labels:**

Python

```
# Separate features (all columns except the last) and labels (last column)
X = data.iloc[:, :-1]  # Features
y = data.iloc[:, -1]  # Labels
```

content_copy

- `X = data.iloc[:, :-1]`: This line selects all columns except the last one from the DataFrame `data` and stores them in a new variable named `

- `y = data.iloc[:, -1]`: This line selects only the last column from the DataFrame `data` and stores it in a new variable named `y`. Here, we assume the last column in your data (`cpdata.csv`) contains the labels (crop categories) you want to predict.

**6. Split Data into Training and Testing Sets:**

Python

```
# Split data into training and testing sets (70% for training, 30% for testing)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3)
```

Use code [with caution.](https://gemini.google.com/faq#coding)

content_copy

- `train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3)`: This line uses the `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn to split the features (`X`) and labels (`y`) into two sets: training and testing. The `test_size` parameter is set to 0.3, which means 30% of the data will be used for testing and the remaining 70% will be used for training the model.

**7. Scale Features:**

Python

```
# Scale features (improves model performance)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

Use code [with caution.](https://gemini.google.com/faq#coding)

content_copy

- `scaler = StandardScaler()`: This line creates a `StandardScaler` object from scikit-learn.
- `X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)`: This line fits the scaler to the training data (`X_train`). The scaler learns the mean and standard deviation of each feature in the training data.
- `X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)`: This line transforms the testing data (`X_test`) using the scaler learned from the training data. It subtracts the mean and divides by the standard deviation for each feature, resulting in features with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Scaling features can improve the performance of many machine learning models, especially decision trees.

**8. Train the Model:**

Python

```
# Create and train a decision tree model (can be replaced with other models)
model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Use code [with caution.](https://gemini.google.com/faq#coding)

content_copy

- `model = DecisionTreeClassifier()`: This line creates a `DecisionTreeClassifier` object from scikit-learn. This creates a decision tree model for classification.
- `model.fit(X_train, y_train)`: This line trains the decision tree model using the training features (`X_train`) and training labels (`y_train`). The model learns the relationships between the features and the labels, allowing it to predict labels for new unseen data.

**9. Evaluate Model Accuracy:**

Python

```
# Evaluate model accuracy on unseen data
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, model.predict(X_test)) * 100
print("Model accuracy:", accuracy)
```

Use code [with caution.](https://gemini.google.com/faq#coding)

content_copy

- `accuracy_score(y_test, model.predict(X_test))`: This line uses the `accuracy_score` function from scikit-learn to calculate the accuracy of the model on the testing data. The `model.predict(X_test)` part predicts labels for the testing features using the trained model. The accuracy score compares these predicted labels with the actual labels (`y_test`) in the testing set.
- `print("Model accuracy:", accuracy)`: This line prints the calculated model accuracy as a percentage.

**Functionality of Libraries:**

- **pandas (pd):** This library provides powerful tools for data analysis and manipulation in Python. It allows you to read data from various file formats (CSV, Excel, etc.), clean and transform data, and perform various analyses.
- **scikit-learn (sklearn):** This is a popular machine learning library in Python. It provides a wide range of tools for various machine learning tasks, including data preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, and more. In this code, we use specific functions from scikit-learn for splitting data, scaling features, building a decision tree model, and evaluating its accuracy.
- **StandardScaler:** This is a specific tool from scikit-learn used for data preprocessing. It helps standardize features by scaling them to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This can improve the performance of many machine learning models, especially those sensitive to feature scales.
- **DecisionTreeClassifier:** This is a specific type of classification model from scikit-learn. It builds a tree-like structure to learn decision rules based on the features and predicts labels for new
