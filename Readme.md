### Code Explanation

The code performs the following steps:

1. **Import Libraries:** It imports necessary libraries for data manipulation (`pandas`), splitting data (`train_test_split`), scaling features (`StandardScaler`), building the model (`DecisionTreeClassifier`), and evaluating performance (`accuracy_score`).
    
2. **Define Crop Labels:** This section defines a list of crop categories (`crops`) that the model will predict. Make sure these labels match the labels present in your data file.
    
3. **Load and Prepare Data:** It loads the data from the CSV file (`cpdata.csv`) using pandas and stores it in a DataFrame named `data`.
    
4. **Handle Categorical Labels (Optional):** This step checks if the label column (`label`) contains text labels for the crops. If so, it converts them into numerical features using one-hot encoding (`pd.get_dummies`) to improve model training.
    
5. **Separate Features and Labels:** It separates the features (all columns except the last) and labels (last column) from the DataFrame and stores them in separate variables (`X` and `y`).
    
6. **Split Data into Training and Testing Sets:** It splits the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`. The training set (70%) is used to train the model, and the testing set (30%) is used to evaluate its performance on unseen data.
    
7. **Scale Features:** It scales the features in the training and testing sets using `StandardScaler`. This improves the performance of the decision tree model by normalizing the features.
    
8. **Train the Model:** It creates a decision tree classification model (`DecisionTreeClassifier`) and trains it on the training features (`X_train`) and labels (`y_train`).
    
9. **Evaluate Model Accuracy:** It evaluates the model's accuracy on the testing data (`X_test`) using `accuracy_score`. The accuracy is printed as a percentage.

**How to Run**

1. **Install Libraries (if needed):** If you don't have `pandas` and `scikit-learn` installed, open your terminal or command prompt and run:
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    pip install pandas scikit-learn
    ```

2. **Update Data File Path (optional):** This code assumes your data is in a file named "cpdata.csv" in the same directory as the script. If your file is located elsewhere, update the file path in the script before running it.
    
3. **Run the Script:** Execute the script using a Python interpreter (e.g., double-click the script or run `python script_name.py` in your terminal).
    

**The output will display the model's accuracy on unseen data.**
